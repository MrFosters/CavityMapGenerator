A python script that started its life out as a Substance Designer graph, the fucntionality of which i ported into this script for use in batch operations - think over 2000 textures. And while the Substance Automation toolkit exists - and it wasnt even locked behind the enterprise license before Allegorithmic got acquired -, it was far easier and quciker to redo the whole thing in python.
The script automatically collects the relevant textures by iterating thought folders and uses fuzzy logic to match a single normal map to multiple sets of AO/Rough/Metal and Albedo textures (assets often had multiple skin variants, but one or two normal maps to save on memory). 
It then creates cavity maps based on the normal maps that then get added into the roughness and albedo maps for a subtle microshadowing effect.
